# Cricket-data-analysis
 Cricket is a sport rich in data, with a wide range of statistics available for each match, player, and team. This project aims to leverage Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool, to analyze and visualize cricket data in a meaningful way.  Using Power BI, we can create interactive dashboards and reports that provide insights into various aspects of the game. For example, we can analyze batting performance by comparing players' average scores, strike rates, and number of centuries. We can also look at bowling performance by analyzing bowlers' average runs conceded, economy rates, and wicket-taking abilities.  Additionally, we can use Power BI to visualize team performance over time, identifying trends and patterns that may influence strategy and decision-making. This project will not only showcase the capabilities of Power BI in sports analytics but also provide valuable insights for cricket enthusiasts, coaches, and analysts.
